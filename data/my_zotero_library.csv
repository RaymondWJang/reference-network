It is time to assemble the pieces of the puzzle of brain computation and to better integrate these separate disciplines. Modern technologies enable us to measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test brain-computational models.

Anecdotes abound of researchers setting up experiments while listening to spikes in real time and observing a pattern of consistent firing when certain stimuli or behaviors happened. With the advent of large-scale recordings, such close observation of data has become harder because high-dimensional spaces are impenetrable to our pattern-finding intuitions. To help ourselves find patterns in neural data, our lab has been openly developing a visualization framework known as “Rastermap” over the past five years. Rastermap takes advantage of a new global optimization algorithm for sorting neural responses along a one-dimensional manifold. Displayed as a raster plot, the sorted neurons show a variety of activity patterns, which can be more easily identified and interpreted. We first benchmark Rastermap on realistic simulations with multiplexed cognitive variables. Then we demonstrate it on recordings of tens of thousands of neurons from mouse visual and sensorimotor cortex during spontaneous, stimulus-evoked and task-evoked epochs, as well as on whole-brain zebrafish recordings, widefield calcium imaging data, population recordings from rat hippocampus and artificial neural networks. Finally, we illustrate high-dimensional scenarios where Rastermap and similar algorithms cannot be used effectively.",8/7/23,1/26/24 17:54,1/26/24 17:54,1/26/24 17:54,,,,,,,Rastermap,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Here we used wireless calcium imaging to longitudinally monitor the activity of dorsal CA1 hippocampal neurons in freely flying bats performing highly reproducible flights in a familiar environment. We find that both the participation and the spatial selectivity of most neurons remain stable over days and weeks. We also find that apparent changes in tuning can be largely attributed to variations in the flight behaviour of the bats. Finally, we show that bats navigating in the same environment under different room lighting conditions (lights on versus lights off) exhibit substantial changes in flight behaviour that can give the illusion of neuronal instability. However, when similar flight paths are compared across conditions, the stability of the hippocampal code persists.

However, such representational drift has been assumed to be a property of high-level brain structures, whereas earlier circuits, such as sensory cortices, have been assumed to stably encode information over time. Here, we analyzed large-scale optical and electrophysiological recordings from six visual cortical areas in behaving mice that were repeatedly presented with the same natural movies. Contrary to the prevailing notion, we found representational drift over timescales spanning minutes to days across multiple visual areas, cortical layers, and cell types. Notably, neural-code stability did not reflect the hierarchy of information flow across areas. Although individual neurons showed time-dependent changes in their coding properties, the structure of the relationships between population activity patterns remained stable and stereotypic.

This bias is exacerbated in Ca2+ imaging because of the temporal sparsity of elevated Ca2+ signals. Here, we introduce methods to correct for the bias in the naïve estimation of information content from limited sample sizes and temporally sparse neuronal activity. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of our methods over previous ones, when applied to Ca2+ imaging data recorded from the mouse hippocampus and primary visual cortex, as well as to simulated data with matching tuning properties and firing statistics. Our bias-correction methods allowed an accurate estimation of the information place cells carry about the animal’s position (spatial information) and uncovered the spatial resolution of hippocampal coding. Furthermore, using our methods, we found that cells with higher peak firing rates carry higher spatial information per spike and exposed differences between distinct hippocampal subfields in the long-term evolution of the spatial code. These results could be masked by the bias when applying the commonly used naïve calculation of information content.

One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement, and abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor underlying task implementation.

For this reason, a central aspect of human learning is the ability to recycle previously acquired knowledge in a way that allows for faster, less resource-intensive acquisition of new skills. In spite of that, how neural networks in the brain leverage existing knowledge to learn new computations is not well understood. In this work, we study this question in artiﬁcial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on a corpus of commonly used neuroscience tasks. Combining brain-inspired inductive biases we call functional and structural, we propose a system that learns new tasks by building on top of pre-trained latent dynamics organised into separate recurrent modules. These modules, acting as prior knowledge acquired previously through evolution or development, are pre-trained on the statistics of the full corpus of tasks so as to be independent and maximally informative. The resulting model, we call a Modular Latent Primitives (MoLaP) network, allows for learning multiple tasks while keeping parameter counts, and updates, low. We also show that the skills acquired with our approach are more robust to a broad range of perturbations compared to those acquired with other multi-task learning strategies, and that generalisation to new tasks is facilitated. This work offers a new perspective on achieving efﬁcient multi-task learning in the brain, illustrating the beneﬁts of leveraging pre-trained latent dynamical primitives.",5/25/22,2/22/24 0:55,2/22/24 0:55,2/22/24 0:55,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2105.14108 [cs, q-bio]",,/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/D4WRSS8F/Márton et al. - 2022 - Efficient and robust multi-task learning in the br.pdf,,,Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2105.14108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we longitudinally recorded large populations of hippocampal neurons in mice while they repeatedly explored two different familiar environments that they visited at different time intervals over weeks.

We introduce the Structure Index (SI) as a directed graph-based metric to quantify the distribution of feature values projected over data in arbitrary D-dimensional spaces (defined from neurons, time stamps, pixels, genes, etc). The SI is defined from the overlapping distribution of data points sharing similar feature values in a given neighborhood of the cloud. Using arbitrary data clouds, we show how the SI provides quantification of the degree and directionality of the local versus global organization of feature distribution. SI can be applied to both scalar and vectorial features permitting quantification of the relative contribution of related variables. When applied to experimental studies of head-direction cells, it is able to retrieve consistent feature structure from both the high- and low-dimensional representations, and to disclose the local and global structure of the angle and speed represented in different brain regions.

Formation of such memories is critically dependent on the hippocampal formation and its inputs from the entorhinal cortex. To be able to support the formation of episodic memories, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation should contain a neuronal code that follows several requirements. First, the code should include information about position of the agent (“where”), sequence of events (“when”), and the content of the experience itself (“what”). Second, the code should arise instantly thereby being able to support memory formation of one-shot experiences. For successful encoding and to avoid interference between memories during recall, variations in location, time, or in content of experience should result in unique ensemble activity. Finally, the code should capture several different resolutions of experience so that the necessary details relevant for future memory-based predictions will be stored. We review how neuronal codes in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus follow these requirements and argue that during formation of episodic memories entorhinal cortex provides hippocampus with instant information about ongoing experience. Such information originates from (a) spatially modulated neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, including grid cells, which provide a stable and universal positional metric of the environment; (b) a continuously varying signal in lateral entorhinal cortex providing a code for the temporal progression of events; and (c) entorhinal neurons coding the content of experiences exemplified by object-coding and odor-selective neurons. During formation of episodic memories, information from these systems are thought to be encoded as unique sequential ensemble activity in hippocampus, thereby encoding associations between the content of an event and its spatial and temporal contexts. Upon exposure to parts of the encoded stimuli, activity in these ensembles can be reinstated, leading to reactivation of the encoded activity pattern and memory recollection.",2019,2/22/24 19:11,2/22/24 19:11,2/22/24 19:11,1190-1205,,12,29,,,Episodic memory,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.23132,,"/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/WGW6KD7S/Sugar and Moser - 2019 - Episodic memory Neuronal codes for what, where, a.pdf; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/EZ5PKCC6/hipo.html",,,place cell; allocentric; cognitive map; egocentric; pattern completion; pattern separation; time cell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
