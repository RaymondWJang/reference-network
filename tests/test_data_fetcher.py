# If your application fetches publication data from external sources
# (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed, CrossRef), you might create a class dedicated
# to this purpose.

#     Attributes: None specific, though could include API keys or rate
#         limiting settings
#     Methods:
#         Methods to fetch data by DOI, title, author, etc.
#         Methods to parse fetched data into Publication objects
