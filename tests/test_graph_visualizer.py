# Depending on the complexity of your visualization requirements, you might
# design a separate class for graph visualization, especially if you plan to
# support different visualization styles or libraries
# (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly, Graphviz).

#     Attributes:
#         Reference to a ReferenceGraph instance
#         Visualization settings (e.g., layout, color scheme)

#     Methods:
#         Constructor to initialize with a ReferenceGraph
#         Method to plot the graph
#         (Optional) Methods to customize the visualization (e.g., set node
#         size based on citation count)
