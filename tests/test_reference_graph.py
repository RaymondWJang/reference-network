# This class is responsible for constructing the network graph from the
# publications, where nodes represent publications and edges represent
# citations between them.

#     Attributes:
#         Graph structure (could use an adjacency list, adjacency matrix, or a
#         library like NetworkX)

#     Methods:
#         Constructor to initialize the graph
#         Method to add a node (publication)
#         Method to add an edge (citation) between nodes
#         Method to visualize the graph
#         (Optional) Methods for graph analysis (e.g., finding the most
#         cited papers)
