# Reference Network

The Reference Network Package is a Python library designed to create, visualize, and analyze reference networks from academic publications. It leverages powerful libraries such as NetworkX for network analysis, PyVis for interactive visualization, and Graphviz for static graph rendering, providing a comprehensive toolset for researchers, librarians, and anyone interested in bibliometrics.

## Features

- **Network Creation**: Easily construct reference networks using publication metadata, including DOIs, titles, and authors.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Generate interactive visualizations of reference networks with PyVis, enabling users to explore the connections between publications through a web-based interface.
- **Static Graph Rendering**: Produce high-quality static images of reference networks using Graphviz, suitable for publication in academic journals or presentations.
- **Analysis Tools**: Utilize NetworkX to calculate network metrics such as centrality, clustering coefficients, and more, offering insights into the structure and characteristics of the reference network.
- **Dynamic Color Support**: Automatically assign colors to disconnected graph components for enhanced visual clarity, with support for dynamic color generation using Seaborn.

## Installation

To install the Reference Network Package, you will need Python 3.6 or later. You can install the package using pip:

```sh
pip install reference_network
