Anecdotes abound of researchers setting up experiments while listening to spikes in real time and observing a pattern of consistent firing when certain stimuli or behaviors happened. With the advent of large-scale recordings, such close observation of data has become harder because high-dimensional spaces are impenetrable to our pattern-finding intuitions. To help ourselves find patterns in neural data, our lab has been openly developing a visualization framework known as “Rastermap” over the past five years. Rastermap takes advantage of a new global optimization algorithm for sorting neural responses along a one-dimensional manifold. Displayed as a raster plot, the sorted neurons show a variety of activity patterns, which can be more easily identified and interpreted. We first benchmark Rastermap on realistic simulations with multiplexed cognitive variables. Then we demonstrate it on recordings of tens of thousands of neurons from mouse visual and sensorimotor cortex during spontaneous, stimulus-evoked and task-evoked epochs, as well as on whole-brain zebrafish recordings, widefield calcium imaging data, population recordings from rat hippocampus and artificial neural networks. Finally, we illustrate high-dimensional scenarios where Rastermap and similar algorithms cannot be used effectively.","2023-08-07","2024-01-26 17:54:56","2024-01-26 17:54:56","2024-01-26 17:54:56","","","","","","","Rastermap","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We find that both the participation and the spatial selectivity of most neurons remain stable over days and weeks. We also find that apparent changes in tuning can be largely attributed to variations in the flight behaviour of the bats. Finally, we show that bats navigating in the same environment under different room lighting conditions (lights on versus lights off) exhibit substantial changes in flight behaviour that can give the illusion of neuronal instability. However, when similar flight paths are compared across conditions, the stability of the hippocampal code persists.

Here, we analyzed large-scale optical and electrophysiological recordings from six visual cortical areas in behaving mice that were repeatedly presented with the same natural movies. Contrary to the prevailing notion, we found representational drift over timescales spanning minutes to days across multiple visual areas, cortical layers, and cell types. Notably, neural-code stability did not reflect the hierarchy of information flow across areas.

This bias is exacerbated in Ca2+ imaging because of the temporal sparsity of elevated Ca2+ signals. Here, we introduce methods to correct for the bias in the naïve estimation of information content from limited sample sizes and temporally sparse neuronal activity. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of our methods over previous ones, when applied to Ca2+ imaging data recorded from the mouse hippocampus and primary visual cortex, as well as to simulated data with matching tuning properties and firing statistics. Our bias-correction methods allowed an accurate estimation of the information place cells carry about the animal’s position (spatial information) and uncovered the spatial resolution of hippocampal coding. Furthermore, using our methods, we found that cells with higher peak firing rates carry higher spatial information per spike and exposed differences between distinct hippocampal subfields in the long-term evolution of the spatial code.

One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement, and abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor underlying task implementation.

For this reason, a central aspect of human learning is the ability to recycle previously acquired knowledge in a way that allows for faster, less resource-intensive acquisition of new skills. In spite of that, how neural networks in the brain leverage existing knowledge to learn new computations is not well understood. In this work, we study this question in artiﬁcial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on a corpus of commonly used neuroscience tasks. Combining brain-inspired inductive biases we call functional and structural, we propose a system that learns new tasks by building on top of pre-trained latent dynamics organised into separate recurrent modules. These modules, acting as prior knowledge acquired previously through evolution or development, are pre-trained on the statistics of the full corpus of tasks so as to be independent and maximally informative. The resulting model, we call a Modular Latent Primitives (MoLaP) network, allows for learning multiple tasks while keeping parameter counts, and updates, low. We also show that the skills acquired with our approach are more robust to a broad range of perturbations compared to those acquired with other multi-task learning strategies, and that generalisation to new tasks is facilitated. This work offers a new perspective on achieving efﬁcient multi-task learning in the brain, illustrating the beneﬁts of leveraging pre-trained latent dynamical primitives.","2022-05-25","2024-02-22 00:55:27","2024-02-22 00:55:27","2024-02-22 00:55:27","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2105.14108 [cs, q-bio]","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/D4WRSS8F/Márton et al. - 2022 - Efficient and robust multi-task learning in the br.pdf","","","Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2105.14108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we longitudinally recorded large populations of hippocampal neurons in mice while they repeatedly explored two different familiar environments that they visited at different time intervals over weeks.

We introduce the Structure Index (SI) as a directed graph-based metric to quantify the distribution of feature values projected over data in arbitrary D-dimensional spaces (defined from neurons, time stamps, pixels, genes, etc). The SI is defined from the overlapping distribution of data points sharing similar feature values in a given neighborhood of the cloud. Using arbitrary data clouds, we show how the SI provides quantification of the degree and directionality of the local versus global organization of feature distribution. SI can be applied to both scalar and vectorial features permitting quantification of the relative contribution of related variables. When applied to experimental studies of head-direction cells, it is able to retrieve consistent feature structure from both the high- and low-dimensional representations, and to disclose the local and global structure of the angle and speed represented in different brain regions. Finally, we provide two general-purpose examples (sound and image categorization), to illustrate the potential application to arbitrary dimensional spaces.

Formation of such memories is critically dependent on the hippocampal formation and its inputs from the entorhinal cortex. To be able to support the formation of episodic memories, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation should contain a neuronal code that follows several requirements. First, the code should include information about position of the agent (“where”), sequence of events (“when”), and the content of the experience itself (“what”). Second, the code should arise instantly thereby being able to support memory formation of one-shot experiences. For successful encoding and to avoid interference between memories during recall, variations in location, time, or in content of experience should result in unique ensemble activity. Finally, the code should capture several different resolutions of experience so that the necessary details relevant for future memory-based predictions will be stored. We review how neuronal codes in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus follow these requirements and argue that during formation of episodic memories entorhinal cortex provides hippocampus with instant information about ongoing experience. Such information originates from (a) spatially modulated neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, including grid cells, which provide a stable and universal positional metric of the environment; (b) a continuously varying signal in lateral entorhinal cortex providing a code for the temporal progression of events; and (c) entorhinal neurons coding the content of experiences exemplified by object-coding and odor-selective neurons. During formation of episodic memories, information from these systems are thought to be encoded as unique sequential ensemble activity in hippocampus, thereby encoding associations between the content of an event and its spatial and temporal contexts. Upon exposure to parts of the encoded stimuli, activity in these ensembles can be reinstated, leading to reactivation of the encoded activity pattern and memory recollection.","2019","2024-02-22 19:11:19","2024-02-22 19:11:19","2024-02-22 19:11:19","1190-1205","","12","29","","","Episodic memory","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.23132","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/WGW6KD7S/Sugar and Moser - 2019 - Episodic memory Neuronal codes for what, where, a.pdf; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/EZ5PKCC6/hipo.html","","","place cell; allocentric; cognitive map; egocentric; pattern completion; pattern separation; time cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we characterized neural representations in monkeys performing a task described by different hidden and explicit variables. Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training, which requires a particular geometry of neural representations. Neural ensembles in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and simulated neural networks simultaneously represented multiple variables in a geometry reflecting abstraction but that still allowed a linear classifier to decode a large number of other variables (high shattering dimensionality). Furthermore, this geometry changed in relation to task events and performance. These findings elucidate how the brain and artificial systems represent variables in an abstract format while preserving the advantages conferred by high shattering dimensionality.","2020-11-12","2024-03-08 22:03:15","2024-03-08 22:47:45","2024-03-08 22:03:15","954-967.e21","","4","183","","Cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/X47VTCL8/Bernardi et al. - 2020 - The Geometry of Abstraction in the Hippocampus and.pdf; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/ELEDJDJ5/S0092867420312289.html","","","abstraction; anterior cingulate cortex; artificial neural networks; dimensionality; disentangled representations; factorized representations; hippocampus; mixed selectivity; prefrontal cortex; representational geometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unclear whether drift is caused by synaptic plasticity elicited by sensory experience, or by the intrinsic volatility of synapses. Here, using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex, we find that the preferred stimulus orientation of individual neurons slowly drifts over the course of weeks. By using cylinder lens goggles to limit visual experience to a narrow range of orientations, we show that the direction of drift, but not its magnitude, is biased by the statistics of visual input. A network model suggests that drift of preferred orientation largely results from synaptic volatility, which under normal visual conditions is counteracted by experience-driven Hebbian mechanisms, stabilizing preferred orientation. Under deprivation conditions these Hebbian mechanisms enable adaptation. Thus, Hebbian synaptic plasticity steers drift to match the statistics of the environment.","2023-09-22","2024-03-19 18:07:20","2024-03-19 18:07:20","2024-03-19 18:07:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","Institution: Neuroscience Type: preprint DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558966","","; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/L2KLUD2L/Bauer et al. - 2023 - Sensory experience steers representational drift i.pdf","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Sensory-experience-steers-representational-drift-in-Bauer-Lewin/2f1c7d56f53ceb0594ac5131d0a8f1701bb98829","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nongeometric information may allow the discrimination of different spatial contexts. Understanding how nongeometric (or contextual) information affects hippocampal activity is important in light of proposals that the hippocampus may play a role in constructing a representation of spatial context. We investigated the contextual modulation of place cell activity by recording hippocampal place cells while rats foraged in compound contexts comprising black or white color paired with lemon or vanilla odor. Some cells responded to the color or odor changes alone, but most responded to varying combinations of both. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a heterogeneous input by contextual inputs into the hippocampus. We propose a model of contextual remapping of place cells in which the geometric inputs are selectively activated by subsets of contextual stimuli. Because it appears that different place cells are affected by different subsets of contextual stimuli, the representation of the entire context would require activity at the population level, supporting a role for the hippocampus in constructing a representation of spatial context.","2003-10-01","2024-03-19 20:42:17","2024-03-19 20:42:17","2024-03-19 20:42:17","8827-8835","","26","23","","J.

The current study sought to extend previous research in this area by examining the effect of substituting a new stimulus for a familiar stimulus in a familiar environment. Hippocampal place cells were recorded while rats chased food pellets scattered onto the floor of a cylindrical apparatus with a white cue card affixed to the apparatus wall. Once a place cell had been recorded in the presence of the white card, the white card was replaced by a black card of the same size and shape. The place cell was then recorded in the presence of the black card. Thirty-six cells were recorded using this procedure. All cells had stable firing fields in the presence of the white card. Both the white and black cards had stimulus control over place cell firing; generally, rotation of either card caused an equal rotation of the firing fields present. When the black card was substituted for the white card, place cells showed time-variant changes in their spatial firing patterns. The change was such that the spatial firing patterns of the majority of place cells were similar in the presence of the white and black cards during initial black card exposures. During subsequent presentations of the black card, the spatial firing patterns associated with the 2 cards became distinct from each other. Once the differentiation of firing patterns had occurred in a given rat, all place cells subsequently recorded from that rat had different firing patterns in the presence of the white and black cards. The findings are discussed relative to sensory-, motor-, attentional-, and learning-related interpretations of hippocampal function. It is argued that the time-variant alteration of place cell firing fields observed following exposure to a novel stimulus in this study reflects an experience-dependent modification of place cell firing patterns.","1991","2024-03-19 20:42:50","2024-03-19 20:42:50","2024-03-19 20:42:50","193-205","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 1991 Churchill Livingstone Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.450010207","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/ZK97I7LW/Bostock et al. - 1991 - Experience-dependent modifications of hippocampal .pdf; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/LXBYPE8M/hipo.html","","","cognitive maps; hippocampal place cells; hippocampal plasticity; spatial representation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation.","2009-10","2024-03-19 20:43:15","2024-03-19 20:43:15","2024-03-19 20:43:15","941-946","","7266","461","","","","","","","","","","en","2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Place cells represented the entire volume of the mazes: their activity tended to be aligned with the maze axes, and when it was more difficult for the animals to move vertically the cells represented space less accurately and less stably.

Attractor dynamics may explain both why neurons react coherently following sufficiently large changes to the environment (discrete attractors) and how firing patterns move smoothly from one representation to the next as an animal moves through space (continuous attractors). However, some features of place cell behavior, such as the sometimes independent responsiveness of place cells to environmental change (called “remapping”), seem hard to reconcile with attractor dynamics. This paper suggests that the explanation may be found in an anatomical separation of the two attractor systems coupled with a dynamic contextual modulation of the connection matrix between the two systems, with new learning being back-propagated into the matrix.

In the study of navigation, this led to a strong focus on the identification of the neural systems underlying egocentric representations and those responsible for allo-centric representations.

Fear conditioning caused many place cells to alter (or remap) their preferred firing locations in the training environment, whereas most cells remained stable in the control environment. This finding indicates that aversive reinforcement can induce place cell remapping even when the environment itself remains unchanged. Furthermore, contextual fear conditioning caused significantly more remapping of place cells than auditory fear conditioning, suggesting that place cell remapping was related to the rat's learned fear of the environment. These results suggest that one possible function of place cell remapping may be to generate new spatial representations of a single environment, which could help the animal to discriminate among different motivational contexts within that environment.","2004-08-04","2024-03-19 20:45:32","2024-03-19 20:45:32","2024-03-19 20:45:32","7015-7023","","31","24","","J.

Rodent research has focused on a class of neurons in the hippocampus implicated in the representation of allocentric space – termed place cells – and the process by which these representations form. One class of models of hippocampal place field formation depends on continuous theta, a low frequency brain oscillation that is prevalent in crawling rodents. Comparative studies of hippocampal activity in echolocating bats have reported many findings that parallel the rodent literature, but also describe noteworthy species differences, especially with respect to theta rhythm. Here, we first discuss studies of the bat hippocampal formation and point to gaps in our knowledge, which motivate our new lines of inquiry. We present data from the free-flying laryngeal echolocating big brown bat, which shows 3-D place cells without continuous theta, similar to reports from the lingual echolocating Egyptian fruit bat.

The geometry of neural trajectories during the production epoch was consistent with a mechanism wherein the measured interval and sensorimotor context exerted control over cortical dynamics by adjusting the system’s initial condition and input, respectively.

Although widely observed across the brain,7-10 such variability is not well understood, and could reflect noise or structure, such as the encoding of additional cognitive information.6,11-13 Here, we introduce a conceptual model to explain variability in terms of underlying, population-level structure in single-trial neural activity. To test this model, we developed a novel unsupervised learning algorithm incorporating temporal dynamics, in order to characterize population activity as a trajectory on a nonlinear manifold—a space of possible network states. The manifold’s structure captures correlations between neurons and temporal relationships between states, constraints arising from underlying network architecture and inputs. Using measurements of activity over time but no information about exogenous behavioral variables, we recovered hippocampal activity manifolds during spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks in rats. Manifolds were low-dimensional and smoothly encoded task-related variables, but contained an extra dimension reflecting information beyond the measured behavioral variables. Consistent with our model, neurons fired as a function of overall network state, and fluctuations in their activity across trials corresponded to variation in the underlying trajectory on the manifold. In particular, the extra dimension allowed the system to take different trajectories despite repeated behavioral conditions. Furthermore, the trajectory could temporarily decouple from current behavioral conditions and traverse neighboring manifold points corresponding to past, future, or nearby behavioral states. Our results suggest that trial-to-trial variability in the hippocampus is structured, and may reflect the operation of internal cognitive processes. The manifold structure of population activity is well-suited for organizing information to support memory,1,5,14 planning,12,15,16 and reinforcement learning.17,18 In general, our approach could find broader use in probing the organization and computational role of circuit dynamics in other brain regions.","2018-09-20","2024-03-19 20:50:44","2024-03-19 20:50:52","2024-03-19 20:50:44","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2018, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We found that there exist exclusive and orthogonal population-level subspaces dedicated to preparatory and movement computations. This orthogonality yielded a reorganization in response correlations: the set of neurons with shared response properties changed completely between preparation and movement. Thus, the same neural population acts, at different times, as two separate circuits with very different properties. This finding is not predicted by existing motor cortical models, which predict overlapping preparation-related and movement-related subspaces.

The hippocampus is the brain region centrally responsible for such maps, and it has been assumed to encode geometric information (distances, angles). Given, however, that hippocampal output consists of patterns of spiking across many neurons, and downstream regions must be able to translate those patterns into accurate information about an animal's spatial environment, we hypothesized that 1) the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information, and 2) since co-firing implies spatial overlap of place fields, a map encoded by co-firing will be based on connectivity and adjacency, i.e., it will be a topological map. Here we test this topological hypothesis with a simple model of hippocampal activity, varying three parameters (firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons) in computer simulations of rat trajectories in three topologically and geometrically distinct test environments. Using a computational algorithm based on recently developed tools from Persistent Homology theory in the field of algebraic topology, we find that the patterns of neuronal co-firing can, in fact, convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. Furthermore, our simulations reveal a “learning region” that highlights the interplay between the parameters in combining to produce hippocampal states that are more or less adept at map formation. For example, within the learning region a lower number of neurons firing can be compensated by adjustments in firing rate or place field size, but beyond a certain point map formation begins to fail. We propose that this learning region provides a coherent theoretical lens through which to view conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity.","2012-08-09","2024-03-19 20:52:16","2024-03-19 20:52:16","2024-03-19 20:52:16","e1002581","","8","8","","PLoS Comput Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/V572K9BS/Dabaghian et al. - 2012 - A Topological Paradigm for Hippocampal Spatial Map.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Topological-Paradigm-for-Hippocampal-Spatial-Map-Dabaghian-M%C3%A9moli/b6f7a064873abe84f77be33fdfc53bdb73dfe18d","","","Fiete, Ila","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories-Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)-which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.","2009-07","2024-03-19 20:53:01","2024-03-19 20:53:01","","614-635","","1","102","","J Neurophysiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 19357332 PMCID: PMC2712272","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/6L6QNPB8/Yu et al. - 2009 - Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimension.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19357332","","Action Potentials; Animals; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neural Networks, Computer; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics; Normal Distribution; Principal Component Analysis; Reaction Time; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, progress has been made in identifying the hippocampal neural activity patterns that implement these functions. One such pattern is the sharp wave–ripple (SWR), an event associated with highly synchronous neural firing in the hippocampus and modulation of neural activity in distributed brain regions. Hippocampal spiking during SWRs can represent past or potential future experience, and SWR-related interventions can alter subsequent memory performance. These findings and others suggest that SWRs support both memory consolidation and memory retrieval for processes such as decision-making. In addition, studies have identified distinct types of SWR based on representational content, behavioural state and physiological features. These various findings regarding SWRs suggest that different SWR types correspond to different cognitive functions, such as retrieval and consolidation. Here, we introduce another possibility — that a single SWR may support more than one cognitive function. Taking into account classic psychological theories and recent molecular results that suggest that retrieval and consolidation share mechanisms, we propose that the SWR mediates the retrieval of stored representations that can be utilized immediately by downstream circuits in decision-making, planning, recollection and/or imagination while simultaneously initiating memory consolidation processes. Sharp wave–ripples (SWRs) are specific neural activity patterns in the hippocampus that are thought to support memory. In this Review, Hannah Joo and Loren Frank explore where and when SWRs are generated and propose a revised view of the role of these activity patterns in memory functions.","2018-12","2024-03-19 20:55:42","2024-03-19 20:55:42","2024-03-19 20:55:42","744-757","","12","19","","Nat Rev Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/BGM7LSWS/Joo and Frank - 2018 - The hippocampal sharp wave–ripple in memory retrie.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-hippocampal-sharp-wave%E2%80%93ripple-in-memory-for-use-Joo-Frank/bdf26032c2141733d6493f864a03a52780e993cf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mice learned new sets of three goal locations daily in a multiwell maze. We used closed-loop SPW-R detection at goal locations to trigger optogenetic silencing of a subset of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Control place cells (nonsilenced or silenced outside SPW-Rs) largely maintained the location of their place fields after learning and showed increased spatial information content. In contrast, the place fields of SPW-R-silenced place cells remapped, and their spatial information remained unaltered. SPW-R silencing did not impact the firing rates or proportions of place cells. These results suggest that interference with SPW-R-associated activity during learning prevents stabilization and refinement of hippocampal maps.","2017-06","2024-03-19 20:58:14","2024-03-19 20:58:14","2024-03-19 20:58:14","845-853","","6","20","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/JS9YE9QY/Roux et al. - 2017 - Sharp wave ripples during learning stabilize the h.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Sharp-wave-ripples-during-learning-stabilize-map-Roux-Hu/a384cd50b1cf2716e33014544d29621580769b06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This view received indirect support by findings in humans of sleep enhancing TMS-evoked plasticity and capabilities for encoding new information.

Using nonlocal ‘replay’ of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task in which an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices versus the gain from propagating newly encountered information to preceding locations.

Based on evidence from neurophysiological and behavioral studies mainly in humans and rodents, we consider the formation of long-term memory during sleep as an active systems consolidation process that is embedded in a process of global synaptic downscaling. Repeated neuronal replay of representations originating from the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep leads to a gradual transformation and integration of representations in neocortical networks. We highlight three features of this process: (i) hippocampal replay that, by capturing episodic memory aspects, drives consolidation of both hippocampus-dependent and non-hippocampus-dependent memory; (ii) brain oscillations hallmarking slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep that provide mechanisms for regulating both information flow across distant brain networks and local synaptic plasticity; and (iii) qualitative transformations of memories during systems consolidation resulting in abstracted, gist-like representations.","2019-10","2024-03-19 21:18:14","2024-03-19 21:18:14","2024-03-19 21:18:14","1598-1610","","10","22","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2019 Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/EE5Z3PRA/Klinzing et al. - 2019 - Mechanisms of systems memory consolidation during .pdf","","","Circadian rhythms and sleep; Learning and memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TMR studies hypothesize that this method taps into normal consolidation mechanisms that require the repeated replay of memories during sleep. This idea has recently been supported by several new studies demonstrating that TMR upregulates the reactivation of cued memories, and that such upregulation predicts subsequent memory performance. This new body of work provides a unique window onto many properties of memory reactivation and helps to close the gap between our understanding of replay in rodents, where it has been visualised at the neural level for many years, and humans, where such studies are only just starting to become possible.

Awake and sleep SWRs both contribute to spatial learning and memory, thought to be mediated by the coordinated reactivation of behavioral experiences in hippocampal-cortical circuits seen during SWRs. Current hypotheses suggest that reactivation contributes to memory consolidation processes, but whether awake and sleep reactivation are suited to play similar or different roles remains unclear. Here we addressed that issue by examining the structure of hippocampal (area CA1) and prefrontal (PFC) activity recorded across behavior and sleep stages in male rats learning a spatial alternation task. We found a striking state difference: prefrontal modulation during awake and sleep SWRs was surprisingly distinct, with differing patterns of excitation and inhibition. CA1-PFC synchronization was stronger during awake SWRs, and spatial reactivation, measured using both pairwise and ensemble measures, was more structured for awake SWRs compared with post-task sleep SWRs. Stronger awake reactivation was observed despite the absence of coordination between network oscillations, namely hippocampal SWRs and cortical delta and spindle oscillations, which is prevalent during sleep. Finally, awake CA1-PFC reactivation was enhanced most prominently during initial learning in a novel environment, suggesting a key role in early learning. Our results demonstrate significant differences in awake and sleep reactivation in the hippocampal-prefrontal network. These findings suggest that awake SWRs support accurate memory storage and memory-guided behavior, whereas sleep SWR reactivation is better suited to support integration of memories across experiences during consolidation.                            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) occur both in the awake state during behavior and in the sleep state after behavior. Awake and sleep SWRs are associated with memory reactivation and are important for learning, but their specific memory functions remain unclear. Here, we found profound differences in hippocampal-cortical reactivation during awake and sleep SWRs, with key implications for their roles in memory. Awake reactivation is a higher-fidelity representation of behavioral experiences, and is enhanced during early learning, without requiring coordination of network oscillations that is seen during sleep. Our findings suggest that awake reactivation is ideally suited to support initial memory formation, retrieval and planning, whereas sleep reactivation may play a broader role in integrating memories across experiences during consolidation.","2017-12-06","2024-03-19 21:19:33","2024-03-19 21:19:33","2024-03-19 21:19:33","11789-11805","","49","37","","J.

Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during “off-line” states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, “p-ripples,” which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease.

These models cross multiple neurobiological levels that include intrinsic membrane resonance, dendritic integration, after hyperpolarization characteristics and attractor dynamics. Despite the breadth of the models, to our knowledge, parallels can be drawn between grid fields and other temporal dynamics observed in nature, much of which was described by Art Winfree and colleagues long before the initial description of grid fields. Using theoretical and mathematical investigations of oscillators, in a wide array of mediums far from the neurobiology of grid cells, Art Winfree has provided a substantial amount of research with significant and profound similarities. These theories provide specific inferences into the biological mechanisms and extraordinary resemblances across phenomenon. Therefore, this manuscript provides a novel interpretation on the phenomenon of grid fields, from the perspective of coupled oscillators, postulating that grid fields are the spatial representation of phase resetting curves in the brain. In contrast to prior models of gird cells, the current manuscript provides a sketch by which a small network of neurons, each with oscillatory components can operate to form grid cells, perhaps providing a unique hybrid between the competing attractor neural network and oscillatory interference models. The intention of this new interpretation of the data is to encourage novel testable hypotheses.","2016-03-08","2024-03-19 21:40:31","2024-03-19 21:40:31","2024-03-19 21:40:31","","","","10","","Front.

The aim of the this article is to review and discuss some of this work, taking as a starting point the discovery of multiple functionally specialized cell types of the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit, such as place, grid, and border cells. We will show that grid cells provide the hippocampus with a metric, as well as a putative mechanism for decorrelation of representations, that the formation of environment-specific place maps depends on mechanisms for long-term plasticity in the hippocampus, and that long-term spatiotemporal memory storage may depend on offline consolidation processes related to sharp-wave ripple activity in the hippocampus.

Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of an animal in its environment, and this location is updated through movement and path integration. In this paper, we propose that grid-like cells in the neocortex represent the location of sensors on an object. We describe a two-layer neural network model that uses cortical grid cells and path integration to robustly learn and recognize objects through movement. Grid cells exhibit regular tiling over environments and are organized into modules, each with its own scale and orientation. A single module encodes position within the spatial scale of the module but is ambiguous over larger spaces. A set of modules can uniquely encode many large spaces. In our model, a layer of cells consisting of several grid-like modules represents a location in the reference frame of a specific object. Another layer of cells which processes sensory input receives this location input as context and uses it to encode the sensory input in the object’s reference frame. Sensory input causes the network to invoke previously learned locations that are consistent with the input, and motor input causes the network to update those locations. Simulations show that the model can learn hundreds of objects even when object features alone are insufficient for disambiguation. We discuss the relationship of the model to cortical circuitry and suggest that the reciprocal connections between layers 4 and 6 fit the requirements of the model. We propose that the subgranular layers of cortical columns employ grid cell like mechanisms to represent object specific locations that are updated through movement.","2019-04-24","2024-03-19 21:42:13","2024-03-19 21:42:13","2024-03-19 21:42:13","22","","","13","","Front.

Despite several known circuits and structures that generate hippocampal theta locally in vitro, none of them were found to be critical in vivo, and the hippocampal theta rhythm is severely attenuated by disruption of external input from medial septum or entorhinal cortex. We investigated these discrepancies that question the sufficiency and robustness of hippocampal theta generation using a biophysical spiking network model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus that included an interconnected network of pyramidal cells, inhibitory basket cells (BC) and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells. The model was developed by matching biological data characterizing neuronal firing patterns, synaptic dynamics, short-term synaptic plasticity, neuromodulatory inputs, and the three-dimensional organization of the hippocampus. The model generated theta power robustly through five cooperating generators: spiking oscillations of pyramidal cells, recurrent connections between them, slow-firing interneurons and pyramidal cells subnetwork, the fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal cells subnetwork, and non-rhythmic structured external input from entorhinal cortex to CA3. We used the modeling framework to quantify the relative contributions of each of these generators to theta power, across different cholinergic states. The largest contribution to theta power was that of the divergent input from the entorhinal cortex to CA3, despite being constrained to random Poisson activity. We found that the low cholinergic states engaged the recurrent connections in generating theta activity, whereas high cholinergic states utilized the OLM-pyramidal subnetwork. These findings revealed that theta might be generated differently across cholinergic states, and demonstrated a direct link between specific theta generators and neuromodulatory states.","2017-08-07","2024-03-19 21:43:30","2024-03-19 21:43:30","2024-03-19 21:43:29","e0182648","","8","12","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/VZAELZ4Y/Hummos and Nair - 2017 - An integrative model of the intrinsic hippocampal .pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-integrative-model-of-the-intrinsic-hippocampal-Hummos-Nair/ee6fd06fc8310576dba75d00343388b13cc37c73","","","Lytton, William W","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is largely due to the complex, multi-scale and nonlinear nature of the brain. To obtain insight into mechanisms underlying the generation of theta rhythms, we develop cellular-based network models of the hippocampus based on a whole hippocampus             in vitro             preparation that spontaneously generates theta rhythms. Building on theoretical and computational analyses, we find that spike frequency adaptation and post-inhibitory rebound constitute a basis for theta generation in large, minimally connected CA1 pyramidal (PYR) cell network models with fast-firing parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory cells. The particular theta frequency is more controlled by PYR to PV+ cell interactions rather than PV+ to PYR cell ones. We identify two scenarios by which theta rhythms can emerge and they can be differentiated by the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory currents to PV+ cells, but not to PYR cells. Only one of the scenarios is consistent with data from the whole hippocampus preparation, which leads to the prediction that the connection probability from PV+ to PYR cells needs to be larger than from PYR to PV+ cells. Our models can serve as a platform on which to build and develop an understanding of             in vivo             theta generation, and of microcircuit dynamics in the hippocampus.                                   Significance             Brain rhythms have been linked to cognition and are disrupted in disease. This makes it essential to understand mechanisms underlying their generation. Theory and mathematical models help provide an understanding and generate hypotheses. Together with experiment they contribute a framework to dissect the cellular contributions to network activity. However, models are inherently biological approximations, and thus the specific experimental and theoretical context upon which they are built will shape their output. If the approximations and contexts are not taken into account, particularly when using previously constructed models, misinterpretations can arise. Here, we use both theory and microcircuit models derived from a specific experimental context to provide insight into cellular-based mechanisms involved in theta rhythm generation in the hippocampus.","2017-03-11","2024-03-19 21:43:50","2024-03-19 21:43:50","2024-03-19 21:43:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","Institution: Neuroscience Type: preprint DOI: 10.1101/115949","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/TWNW959K/Ferguson et al. - 2017 - Combining theory, model and experiment to understa.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Combining-theory%2C-model-and-experiment-to-how-theta-Ferguson-Chatzikalymniou/fb66da6bcfab51a987949bd81f7dbf3dde2ce10e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hippocampal phase precession and theta sequences are thought to provide a biological mechanism for sequential ordering of experience at timescales suitable for plasticity. These phenomena have not previously been examined in any models of schizophrenia risk. Here, we examine these phenomena in a maternal immune activation (MIA) rodent model. We show that while individual pyramidal cells in the CA1 region continue to precess normally in MIA animals, the starting phase of precession as an animal enters a new place field is considerably more variable in MIA animals than in controls. A critical consequence of this change is a disorganization of the ordered representation of experience via theta sequences. These results provide the first evidence of a biological-level mechanism that, if it occurs in schizophrenia, may explain aspects of disorganized sequential processing that contribute to the cognitive symptoms of the disorder. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hippocampal phase precession and theta sequences have been proposed as biophysical mechanisms by which the sequential structure of cognition might be ordered. Disturbances of sequential processing have frequently been observed in schizophrenia. Here, we show for the first time that phase precession and theta sequences are disrupted in a maternal immune activation (MIA) model of schizophrenia risk. This is a result of greater variability in the starting phase of precession, indicating that the mechanisms that coordinate precession at the assembly level are disrupted. We propose that this disturbance in phase precession underlies some of the disorganized cognitive symptoms that occur in schizophrenia. These findings could have important preclinical significance for the identification and treatment of schizophrenia risk factors.","2021-08-11","2024-03-19 21:44:26","2024-03-19 21:44:26","2024-03-19 21:44:26","6954-6965","","32","41","","J.

Additionally, the activity of hippocampal neurons exhibits a particular temporal relationship to the hippocampal EEG, such that spikes fired by the neuron occur at progressively earlier phases of the co-occurring theta rhythm in the EEG as the animal traverses the place field. This relationship is known as theta precession. A long-standing prediction following the observation of theta precession has been that among a collection of hippocampal neurons recorded simultaneously, the neurons will fire in sequences reflecting the behavioral order of the place fields. Here we examine this prediction. We show that clear, ordered sequences occur during theta, which we name theta sequences, in which a portion of the animal's spatial experience is played out in forwards order. We further investigate the relationship of theta sequences to phase precession by shuffling spike phases in such a way as to preserve the relationship between spike phase and position. This jitter significantly reduces the prevalence of theta sequences while leaving theta phase precession intact, suggesting that the presence of theta phase precession is not trivially predictive of theta sequences.

The present study makes use of large‐scale parallel recordings to clarify and extend this finding in several ways: 1) Most CA1 pyramidal cells show maximal activity at the same phase of the theta cycle. Although individual units exhibit deeper modulation, the depth of modulation of CA1 population activity is about 50%. The peak firing of inhibitory interneurons in CA1 occurs about 60° in advance of the peak firing of pyramidal cells, but different interneurons vary widely in their peak phases. 2) The first spikes, as the rat enters a pyramidal cell's place field, come 90°–120° after the phase of maximal pyramidal cell population activity, near the phase where inhibition is least. 3) The phase advance is typically an accelerating, rather than linear, function of position within the place field. 4) These phenomena occur both on linear tracks and in two‐dimensional environments where locomotion is not constrained to specific paths. 5) In two‐dimensional environments, place‐related firing is more spatially specific during the early part of the theta cycle than during the late part. This is also true, to a lesser extent, on a linear track. Thus, spatial selectivity waxes and wanes over the theta cycle. 6) Granule cells of the fascia dentata are also modulated by theta. The depth of modulation for the granule cell population approaches 100%, and the peak activity of the granule cell population comes about 90° earlier in the theta cycle than the peak firing of CA1 pyramidal cells. 7) Granule cells, like pyramidal cells, show robust phase precession. 8) Cross‐correlation analysis shows that portions of the temporal sequence of CA1 pyramidal cell place fields are replicated repeatedly within individual theta cycles, in highly compressed form. The compression ratio can be as much as 10:1.","1996","2024-03-19 22:18:44","2024-03-19 22:18:44","2024-03-19 22:18:44","149-172","","2","6","","Hippocampus","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/VA8GCQVE/Skaggs et al. - 1996 - Theta phase precession in hippocampal neuronal pop.pdf","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Theta-phase-precession-in-hippocampal-neuronal-and-Skaggs-McNaughton/7983cc562a8ea2df4198d8b9525ff120eba34fd4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the rodent hippocampus, the representation of sequentially organized spatial locations is reflected by the phase of action potentials relative to the theta oscillation (phase precession). We investigated whether the timing of neuronal activity relative to the theta brain oscillation also reflects sequence order in the medial temporal lobe of humans. We used a task in which human participants learned a fixed sequence of pictures and recorded single neuron and local field potential activity with implanted electrodes. We report that spikes for three consecutive items in the sequence (the preferred stimulus for each cell, as well as the stimuli immediately preceding and following it) were phase-locked at distinct phases of the theta oscillation. Consistent with phase precession, spikes were fired at progressively earlier phases as the sequence advanced. These findings generalize previous findings in the rodent hippocampus to the human temporal lobe and suggest that encoding stimulus information at distinct oscillatory phases may play a role in maintaining sequential order in memory.","2021-08-10","2024-03-19 22:20:49","2024-03-19 22:20:49","2024-03-19 22:20:49","4839","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/5GH3JYHX/Reddy et al. - 2021 - Theta-phase dependent neuronal coding during seque.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Theta-phase-dependent-neuronal-coding-during-in-Reddy-Self/a2c02f2ed16b1af373f89741134d220e6b4567bd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.","2018-01-12","2024-03-19 22:21:47","2024-03-19 22:21:47","2024-03-19 22:21:34","218-224","","6372","359","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/PXMC9X7E/Omer et al. - 2018 - Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Social-place-cells-in-the-bat-hippocampus-Omer-Maimon/b07da5090aef5fe8d74a9f4d034cd06be2bec4f5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dendritic integration is a hierarchical process, proposed to be equivalent to integration by a multilayer network, potentially endowing single neurons with substantial computational power. However, whether neurons can learn to harness dendritic properties to realize this potential is unknown. Here, we develop a learning rule from dendritic cable theory and use it to investigate the processing capacity of a detailed pyramidal neuron model. We show that computations using spatial or temporal features of synaptic input patterns can be learned, and even synergistically combined, to solve a canonical nonlinear feature-binding problem. The voltage dependence of the learning rule drives coactive synapses to engage dendritic nonlinearities, whereas spike-timing dependence shapes the time course of subthreshold potentials. Dendritic input-output relationships can therefore be flexibly tuned through synaptic plasticity, allowing optimal implementation of nonlinear functions by single neurons.","2021-12-15","2024-03-19 22:26:04","2024-03-19 22:26:04","2024-03-19 22:26:04","4001-4017.e10","","24","109","","Neuron","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/LCFZYK2T/Bicknell and Häusser - 2021 - A synaptic learning rule for exploiting nonlinear .pdf; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/KF3YVVTB/S0896627321007170.html","","","biophysical model; cable theory; dendritic computation; feature-binding problem; learning rule; morphology; NMDA receptors; pyramidal neuron; synaptic plasticity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies, holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch integration.

Most studies focus on how supralinear summation of excitatory synaptic responses arising from clustered inputs within single dendrites result in the enhancement of neuronal firing, enabling simple computations such as feature detection. Recent reports have shown that sublinear summation is also a prominent dendritic operation, extending the range of subthreshold input-output (sI/O) transformations conferred by dendrites. Like supralinear operations, sublinear dendritic operations also increase the repertoire of neuronal computations, but feature extraction requires different synaptic connectivity strategies for each of these operations. In this article we will review the experimental and theoretical findings describing the biophysical determinants of the three primary classes of dendritic operations: linear, sublinear, and supralinear. We then review a Boolean algebra-based analysis of simplified neuron models, which provides insight into how dendritic operations influence neuronal computations. We highlight how neuronal computations are critically dependent on the interplay of dendritic properties (morphology and voltage-gated channel expression), spiking threshold and distribution of synaptic inputs carrying particular sensory features. Finally, we describe how global (scattered) and local (clustered) integration strategies permit the implementation of similar classes of computations, one example being the object feature binding problem.","2015","2024-03-19 22:27:47","2024-03-19 22:27:47","2024-03-19 22:27:47","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/GJTKZUAY/Tran-Van-Minh et al. - 2015 - Contribution of sublinear and supralinear dendriti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in different neuronal types.

A temporally convolutional DNN with five to eight layers was required to capture the I/O mapping of a realistic model of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell (L5PC). This DNN generalized well when presented with inputs widely outside the training distribution. When NMDA receptors were removed, a much simpler network (fully connected neural network with one hidden layer) was sufficient to fit the model. Analysis of the DNNs’ weight matrices revealed that synaptic integration in dendritic branches could be conceptualized as pattern matching from a set of spatiotemporal templates.

Spikelets have been assigned important functions, ranging from neuronal synchronization to the regulation of synaptic plasticity, which are specific to the particular mechanism of spikelet generation. As spikelets reflect spiking activity in neuronal compartments that are electrotonically distinct from the soma, four modes of spikelet generation can be envisaged: (1) dendritic spikes or (2) axonal action potentials occurring in a single cell as well as action potentials transmitted via (3) gap junctions or (4) ephaptic coupling in pairs of neurons. In one of the best studied neuron type, cortical pyramidal neurons, the origins and functions of spikelets are still unresolved; all four potential mechanisms have been proposed, but the experimental evidence remains ambiguous. Here we attempt to reconcile the scattered experimental findings in a coherent theoretical framework. We review in detail the various mechanisms that can give rise to spikelets. For each mechanism, we present the biophysical underpinnings as well as the resulting properties of spikelets and compare these predictions to experimental data from pyramidal neurons. We also discuss the functional implications of each mechanism. On the example of pyramidal neurons, we illustrate that several independent spikelet-generating mechanisms fulfilling vastly different functions might be operating in a single cell.","2019-12-18","2024-03-19 22:32:33","2024-03-19 22:32:33","","101-119","","1","31","","Rev Neurosci","Spikelets in pyramidal neurons","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31437125","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/HBHW9TG7/Michalikova et al. - 2019 - Spikelets in pyramidal neurons generating mechani.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437125","","action potential initiation; Action Potentials; Animals; axon initial segment; Brain; Cortical Excitability; dendritic spikes; ephaptic coupling; gap junction; Humans; Pyramidal Cells; Synaptic Potentials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains – including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry – are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies.

Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that “neuronal avalanches” may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.","2003-12-03","2024-03-19 22:48:56","2024-03-19 22:48:56","2024-03-19 22:48:56","11167-11177","","35","23","","J.

Neuronal oscillations orchestrate such distributed processing through transient amplitude and phase coupling, yet surprisingly, little is known about local network properties facilitating these functional connections. Here, we test whether criticality, a dynamical state characterized by scale-free oscillations, optimizes the capacity of neuronal networks to couple through amplitude or phase, and transfer information. We coupled               in silico               networks which exhibit oscillations in the α band (8–16 Hz), and varied excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. We found that phase coupling of oscillations emerges at criticality, and that amplitude coupling, as well as information transfer, are maximal when networks are critical. Importantly, regulating criticality through modulation of synaptic gain showed that critical dynamics, as opposed to a static ratio of excitatory and inhibitory connections, optimize network coupling and information transfer. Our data support the idea that criticality is important for local and global information processing and may help explain why brain disorders characterized by local alterations in criticality also exhibit impaired long-range synchrony, even before degeneration of axonal connections.

Empirical evidence suggests that long-range amplitude and phase coupling of oscillations are systems-level mechanisms enabling transient formation of spatially distributed functional networks on the backbone of a relatively static structural connectome. However, surprisingly little is known about the local network properties that optimize coupling and information transfer.

However, the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous, task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal–entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.","2017-03","2024-03-19 22:54:48","2024-03-19 22:54:48","2024-03-19 22:54:48","719-722","","7647","543","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/K6CHPJLM/Aronov et al. - 2017 - Mapping of a non-spatial dimension by the hippocam.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Mapping-of-a-non-spatial-dimension-by-the-circuit-Aronov-Nevers/adc8255afb2906812bbbeed8129b4edc75aff35e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This allows previously learnt structure to be exploited to solve tasks in novel situations differing in their particularities. We take inspiration from neuroscience, specifically the hippocampal-entorhinal system known to be important for generalisation. We propose that to generalise structural knowledge, the representations of the structure of the world, i.e. how entities in the world relate to each other, need to be separated from representations of the entities themselves. We show, under these principles, artificial neural networks embedded with hierarchy and fast Hebbian memory, can learn the statistics of memories and generalise structural knowledge. Spatial neuronal representations mirroring those found in the brain emerge, suggesting spatial cognition is an instance of more general organising principles. We further unify many entorhinal cell types as basis functions for constructing transition graphs, and show these representations effectively utilise memories.

But what is a memory? There has been a long history of searching for the neuronal substrate that forms memory in the brain, and the emerging view is that ensembles of engram cells explain how memories are formed and retrieved. In a Review, Josselyn and Tonegawa discuss the evidence for engram cells as a substrate of memory, particularly in rodents; what we have learned so far about the features of memory, including memory formation, retrieval over time, and loss; and future directions to understand how memory becomes knowledge.                            Science               , this issue p.               eaaw4325                        ,                             BACKGROUND               The idea that memory is stored as enduring changes in the brain dates back at least to the time of Plato and Aristotle (circa 350 BCE), but its scientific articulation emerged in the 20th century when Richard Semon introduced the term “engram” to describe the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories. Essentially, Semon proposed that an experience activates a population of neurons that undergo persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram. Subsequent reactivation of the engram by cues available at the time of the experience induces memory retrieval. After Karl Lashley failed to find the engram in a rat brain, studies attempting to localize an engram were largely abandoned. Spurred by Donald O. Hebb’s theory that augmented synaptic strength and neuronal connectivity are critical for memory formation, many researchers showed that enhanced synaptic strength was correlated with memory. Nonetheless, the causal relationship between these enduring changes in synaptic connectivity with a specific, behaviorally identifiable memory at the level of the cell ensemble (an engram) awaited further advances in experimental technologies.                                         ADVANCES               The resurgence in research examining engrams may be linked to two complementary studies that applied intervention strategies to target individual neurons in an engram supporting a specific memory in mice. One study showed that ablating the subset of lateral amygdala neurons allocated to a putative engram disrupted subsequent memory retrieval (loss of function). The second study showed that artificially reactivating a subset of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons that were active during a fearful experience (and, therefore, part of a putative engram) induced memory retrieval in the absence of external retrieval cues (gain of function). Subsequent findings from many labs used similar strategies to identify engrams in other brain regions supporting different types of memory.               There are several recent advances in engram research. First, eligible neurons within a given brain region were shown to compete for allocation to an engram, and relative neuronal excitability determines the outcome of this competition. Excitability-based competition also guides the organization of multiple engrams in the brain and determines how these engrams interact. Second, research examining the nature of the off-line, enduring changes in engram cells (neurons that are critical components of an engram) found increased synaptic strength and spine density in these neurons as well as preferential connectivity to other downstream engram cells. Therefore, both increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity work hand in hand to form engrams, and these mechanisms are also implicated in memory consolidation and retrieval processes. Third, it is now possible to artificially manipulate memory encoding and retrieval processes to generate false memories, or even create a memory in mice without any natural sensory experience (implantation of a memory for an experience that did not occur). Fourth, “silent” engrams were discovered in amnesic mice; artificial reactivation of silent engrams induces memory retrieval, whereas natural cues cannot. Endogenous engram silencing may contribute to the change in memory over time (e.g., systems memory consolidation) or in different circumstances (e.g., fear memory extinction). These findings suggest that once formed, an engram may exist in different states (from silent to active) on the basis of their retrievability. Although initial engram studies focused on single brain regions, an emerging concept is that a given memory is supported by an engram complex, composed of functionally connected engram cell ensembles dispersed across multiple brain regions, with each ensemble supporting a component of the overall memory.                                         OUTLOOK               The ability to identify and manipulate engram cells and brainwide engram complexes has introduced an exciting new era of memory research. The findings from many labs are beginning to define an engram as the basic unit of memory. However, many questions remain. In the short term, it is critical to characterize how information is stored in an engram, including how engram architecture affects memory quality, strength, and precision; how multiple engrams interact; how engrams change over time; and the role of engram silencing in these processes. The long-term goal of engram research is to leverage the fundamental findings from rodent engram studies to understand how information is acquired, stored, and used in humans and facilitate the treatment of human memory, or other information-processing, disorders. The development of low- to noninvasive technology may enable new human therapies based on the growing knowledge of engrams in rodents.                                                   An engram cell alongside a nonengram cell.                   Within the hippocampus, dentate gyrus cells were filled with biocytin (white) to examine morphology. Engram cells active during context fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink owing to overlap with biocytin signals. Axons of the perforant path (green) express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin 2 and a fluorescent marker (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein). The upper blade of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer is revealed by the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue).

We review recent progress in studying engrams, including an evaluation of evidence for the existence of engrams, the importance of intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in engrams, and the lifetime of an engram.

Here, we manipulated excitability by overexpressing CREB in a random population of DG neurons and examined whether this biased their recruitment to an engram supporting a contextual fear memory. To directly assess whether neurons overexpressing CREB at the time of training became critical components of the engram, we examined memory expression while the activity of these neurons was silenced. Chemogenetically (hM4Di, an inhibitory DREADD receptor) or optogenetically (iC++, a light-activated chloride channel) silencing the small number of CREB-overexpressing DG neurons attenuated memory expression, whereas silencing a similar number of random neurons not overexpressing CREB at the time of training did not. As post-encoding reactivation of the activity patterns present during initial experience is thought to be important in memory consolidation, we investigated whether post-training silencing of neurons allocated to an engram disrupted subsequent memory expression. We found that silencing neurons 5 min (but not 24 h) following training disrupted memory expression.

During the formation of a conditioned fear memory, a subset of principal (excitatory) neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA) are allocated to a neuronal ensemble that encodes an association between an initially neutral stimulus and a threatening aversive stimulus. Previous experimental and computational work suggests that this subset consists of only a small proportion of all LA neurons, and that this proportion remains constant across different memories. Here we examine the mechanisms that contribute to the stability of the size of the LA component of an engram supporting a fear memory. Visualizing expression of the activity-dependent gene Arc following memory retrieval to identify neurons allocated to an engram, we first show that the overall size of the LA engram remains constant across conditions of different memory strength. That is, the strength of a memory was not correlated with the number of LA neurons allocated to the engram supporting that memory. We then examine potential mechanisms constraining the size of the LA engram by expressing inhibitory DREADDS (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons of the amygdala. We find that silencing PV+ neurons during conditioning increases the size of the engram, especially in the dorsal subnucleus of the LA. These results confirm predictions from modeling studies regarding the role of inhibition in shaping the size of neuronal memory ensembles and provide additional support for the idea that neurons in the LA are sparsely allocated to the engram based on relative neuronal excitability.","2016-11-01","2024-03-20 01:36:43","2024-03-20 01:36:43","2024-03-20 01:36:43","91-99","","","135","","Neurobiology of Learning and Memory","","MCCS 2016","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/R2TGUAB5/Morrison et al. - 2016 - Parvalbumin interneurons constrain the size of the.pdf; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/7H7UW4Z9/S1074742716301071.html","","","Engram; Fear; Lateral amygdala; Memory; Parvalbumin; Sparse coding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) such as egr-1, c-fos, and Arc is rapidly and selectively upregulated in subsets of neurons in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory formation. IEG expression has therefore been widely used as a molecular marker for neuronal populations that undergo plastic changes underlying formation of long-term memory. In recent years, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic studies of neurons expressing c-fos or Arc have revealed that, during learning, IEG-positive neurons encode and store information that is required for memory recall, suggesting that they may be involved in formation of the memory trace. However, despite accumulating evidence for the role of IEGs in synaptic plasticity, the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with this process remain unclear. In this review, we first summarize recent literature concerning the role of IEG-expressing neuronal ensembles in organizing the memory trace. We then focus on the physiological significance of IEGs, especially Arc, in synaptic plasticity, and describe our hypotheses about the importance of Arc expression in various types of input-specific circuit reorganization. Finally, we offer perspectives on Arc function that would unveil the role of IEG-expressing neurons in the formation of memory traces in the hippocampus and other brain areas.","2016-01-05","2024-03-20 01:40:05","2024-03-20 01:40:05","2024-03-20 01:40:05","","","","8","","Front.

This property of memory has been used clinically to treat maladaptive behaviours. However, the neuronal mechanisms and brain circuits that enable the switching of the valence of memories remain largely unknown. Here we investigated these mechanisms by applying the recently developed memory engram cell- manipulation technique. We labelled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) a population of cells in either the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus or the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) that were specifically activated during contextual fear or reward conditioning. Both groups of fear-conditioned mice displayed aversive light-dependent responses in an optogenetic place avoidance test, whereas both DG- and BLA-labelled mice that underwent reward conditioning exhibited an appetitive response in an optogenetic place preference test. Next, in an attempt to reverse the valence of memory within a subject, mice whose DG or BLA engram had initially been labelled by contextual fear or reward conditioning were subjected to a second conditioning of the opposite valence while their original DG or BLA engram was reactivated by blue light. Subsequent optogenetic place avoidance and preference tests revealed that although the DG-engram group displayed a response indicating a switch of the memory valence, the BLA-engram group did not. This switch was also evident at the cellular level by a change in functional connectivity between DG engram-bearing cells and BLA engram-bearing cells. Thus, we found that in the DG, the neurons carrying the memory engram of a given neutral context have plasticity such that the valence of a conditioned response evoked by their reactivation can be reversed by re-associating this contextual memory engram with a new unconditioned stimulus of an opposite valence. Our present work provides new insight into the functional neural circuits underlying the malleability of emotional memory.","2014-09","2024-03-20 01:41:22","2024-03-20 01:41:22","2024-03-20 01:41:21","426-430","","7518","513","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/QGD679CQ/Redondo et al. - 2014 - Bidirectional switch of the valence associated wit.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bidirectional-switch-of-the-valence-associated-with-Redondo-Kim/a61b92a94e3a380f742e9a9e286ca3f954ddba67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Being highly imaginative animals, humans constantly recall past experiences. These internally generated stimuli sometimes get associated with concurrent external stimuli, which can lead to the formation of false memories.                                Ramirez                 et al.                              (p.               387               ; see the cover) identified a population of cells in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus that encoded a particular context and were able to generate a false memory and study its neural and behavioral interactions with true memories. Optogenetic reactivation of memory engram–bearing cells was not only sufficient for the behavioral recall of that memory, but could also serve as a conditioned stimulus for the formation of an associative memory.                        ,              Associations can be artificially created through reactivation of memory engrams in mouse dentate gyrus granule cells.           ,              Memories can be unreliable. We created a false memory in mice by optogenetically manipulating memory engram–bearing cells in the hippocampus. Dentate gyrus (DG) or CA1 neurons activated by exposure to a particular context were labeled with channelrhodopsin-2. These neurons were later optically reactivated during fear conditioning in a different context. The DG experimental group showed increased freezing in the original context, in which a foot shock was never delivered. The recall of this false memory was context-specific, activated similar downstream regions engaged during natural fear memory recall, and was also capable of driving an active fear response. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to generate an internally represented and behaviorally expressed fear memory via artificial means.","2013-07-26","2024-03-20 01:41:39","2024-03-20 01:41:39","2024-03-20 01:41:39","387-391","","6144","341","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","; /Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/RKVR3XPS/Ramirez et al. - 2013 - Creating a False Memory in the Hippocampus.pdf","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Creating-a-False-Memory-in-the-Hippocampus-Ramirez-Liu/e6bc9cfa286fed5eb05bc93b829154276a114949","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These neurons can be tagged during learning for subsequent identification and manipulation. Moreover, their ablation or inactivation results in reduced memory expression, suggesting their necessity in mnemonic processes. However, the question of sufficiency remains: it is unclear whether it is possible to elicit the behavioural output of a specific memory by directly activating a population of neurons that was active during learning. Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context specific. Together, our findings indicate that activating a sparse but specific ensemble of hippocampal neurons that contribute to a memory engram is sufficient for the recall of that memory. Moreover, our experimental approach offers a general method of mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams.","2012-04","2024-03-20 01:42:09","2024-03-20 01:42:09","2024-03-20 01:42:09","381-385","","7394","484","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/2NXGVIDJ/Liu et al. - 2012 - Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampal engram ac.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Optogenetic-stimulation-of-a-hippocampal-engram-Liu-Ramirez/0b127ed9440c212376d424293d6488758118de77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is an extensive literature on how specific types of memory engage different parts of the brain, and how neurons in these regions process and store information. Until recently, however, the mechanisms that determine how specific cells and synapses within a neural circuit (and not their neighbors) are recruited during learning have received little attention. Recent findings suggest that memory allocation is not random, but rather specific mechanisms regulate where information is stored within a neural circuit. New methods that allow tagging, imaging, activation, and inactivation of neurons in behaving animals promise to revolutionize studies of brain circuits, including memory allocation. Results from these studies are likely to have a considerable impact on computer science, as well as on the understanding of memory and its disorders.","2009-10-16","2024-03-20 01:42:29","2024-03-20 01:42:29","2024-03-20 01:42:29","391-395","","5951","326","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/raymond/Zotero/storage/3YM6NHQ9/Silva et al. - 2009 - Molecular and Cellular Approaches to Memory Alloca.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Molecular-and-Cellular-Approaches-to-Memory-in-Silva-Zhou/fa760f6b027c6ab36b9c792afbabdd63a67a27a3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
